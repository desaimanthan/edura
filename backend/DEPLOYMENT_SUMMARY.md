# Koyeb Deployment - Files Created & Next Steps

## âœ… Files Created for Deployment

The following files have been created to enable Koyeb deployment:

### 1. **Dockerfile** 
- Production-optimized container configuration
- Uses Python 3.11 slim image
- Non-root user for security
- Built-in health checks
- Optimized for Koyeb's environment

### 2. **.dockerignore**
- Excludes unnecessary files from build context
- Reduces image size and build time
- Excludes development files, logs, and cache

### 3. **koyeb.yaml** (Optional)
- Service configuration file
- Defines scaling, health checks, and resource limits
- Can be used for infrastructure-as-code deployment

### 4. **main.py** (Updated)
- Added production environment detection
- Optimized logging for production
- Enhanced CORS configuration
- Disabled API docs in production for security

### 5. **requirements.txt** (Updated)
- Added `requests>=2.31.0` for health check functionality

### 6. **KOYEB_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md**
- Comprehensive step-by-step deployment guide
- Environment variable configuration
- Troubleshooting tips
- Testing and monitoring instructions

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Koyeb deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Koyeb
Follow the detailed instructions in `KOYEB_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`:

1. **Login to Koyeb Dashboard**: https://app.koyeb.com
2. **Create New Service** from GitHub repository
3. **Configure Build Settings**:
   - Build method: Docker
   - Dockerfile path: `backend/Dockerfile`
   - Build context: `backend/`
4. **Set Environment Variables** (all the variables from your `.env`)
5. **Deploy and Monitor**

### 3. Required Environment Variables
Make sure to set these in Koyeb dashboard:

```
ENVIRONMENT=production
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
DATABASE_NAME=your-database-name
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-production-jwt-secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your-r2-account-id
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-r2-access-key
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-r2-secret-access-key
R2_ENDPOINT_URL=your-r2-endpoint-url
R2_BUCKET_NAME=your-r2-bucket-name
R2_PUBLIC_URL=your-r2-public-url
```

### 4. Test Deployment
Once deployed, test these endpoints:
- Health check: `https://your-service-url.koyeb.app/health`
- API root: `https://your-service-url.koyeb.app/`
- Authentication: `https://your-service-url.koyeb.app/auth/register`

## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All files committed and pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Koyeb service created and configured
- [ ] All environment variables set in Koyeb dashboard
- [ ] Service deployed successfully
- [ ] Health check endpoint responding
- [ ] API endpoints accessible
- [ ] CORS configured for frontend domain
- [ ] Database connection working
- [ ] Authentication flow tested

## ðŸ”§ Production Optimizations Applied

1. **Security**:
   - API documentation disabled in production
   - Non-root user in Docker container
   - Environment-based configuration

2. **Performance**:
   - Optimized Docker image size
   - Reduced logging in production
   - Proper health checks for load balancing

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Health check endpoint at `/health`
   - Error logging in production
   - Request timing information

## ðŸ“ž Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the detailed `KOYEB_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
2. Review Koyeb service logs in the dashboard
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
4. Test database connectivity separately
